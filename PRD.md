# PRD — Job Application Agent (Masterclass Session 11 Capstone)

Drop this file into the empty project folder as `PRD.md` before recording. Run `claude`, then `/init`,
then point Claude at this file to start planning.

## 1. What This Is

A job application AI agent, built from scratch for the final Claude Code Masterclass video. It
finds Full-Stack Software Engineer (Java/Spring Boot/Angular) postings, tailors a resume to each
one, and hosts itself to run every day.

**Candidate:** Akhil Dalali, Software Engineer (Java, Spring Boot, Angular, AWS).
Base resume lives at `resume/base_resume.md` (Java/Spring Boot/Angular/AWS, ~4 yrs experience).

## 2. Goal

End to end, one run should:
1. Pull fresh Full-Stack Software Engineer (Java/Spring Boot/Angular) job postings.
2. Score each against the base resume's skills/experience.
3. Keep only jobs scoring 8+/10 fit.
4. Tailor the resume per qualifying job (no fabrication).
5. Log each qualifying job to a Google Sheet (job link + resume link + score).
6. Save each tailored resume as a file in its own per-job folder (Desktop locally, Drive on Modal).
7. Run unattended, every morning, hosted on Modal.

## 3. Pipeline Steps

### 3.1 Scrape
- Source: Apify (free tier), an actor that covers LinkedIn job search.
- Niche: Full-Stack Software Engineer / Java Developer (Java, Spring Boot, Angular), remote or
  hybrid, full-time.
- Output: list of `{title, company, link, description, posted_date}`.

### 3.2 Score + Filter
- Compare each job's requirements against `resume/base_resume.md` skills/experience, extracting
  matched/missing requirements as part of the same scoring call (no separate parse step).
- Score 1-10 fit.
- **Hard cutoff: only jobs scoring 8 or higher continue past this step.**
- Log the reject count too (e.g. "10 scraped, 3 qualified") — this is the on-camera proof the
  filter is doing real work.

### 3.3 Tailor Resume (Skill)
- `.claude/skills/tailor-resume/SKILL.md`
- Input: base resume + the job's matched/missing requirements.
- Output: reordered/re-emphasized experience, mirrored language, matching keywords.
- **Hard rule: never invent experience, employers, tools, or metrics. Reorder and reword only.**

### 3.4 Validate (Hook)
- Before a tailored resume is saved or logged: check required sections are present
  (Summary, Skills, Experience, no placeholder text left over).
- On a validation failure, do not write the row — flag it instead.

### 3.5 Company Research
- `scripts/company_research.py` — per qualifying job, one OpenRouter call returns 3-5 talking
  points (used for context, not written verbatim into the resume). This runs as a plain script,
  not a Claude Code subagent, since the automated Modal path has no live interactive session for a
  subagent to run in.

### 3.6 Outputs
- **Google Sheet** (one row per qualifying job): job title, company, job link, fit score, resume
  file link/path, status, timestamp.
- **Per-job folder**, named `{company}-{job-title-slug}/`, containing the tailored resume file —
  nested under one `Job Applications/` parent folder on the Desktop for the interactive path, in
  Google Drive for the automated Modal path (which has no Desktop access). The Sheet row
  references this folder/file either way.

### 3.7 Headless + Hosting
- The automated path (`scripts/tailor_job.py`, `scripts/company_research.py`) uses OpenRouter
  instead of live Claude reasoning, so it can run unattended without an Anthropic API key.
- Deploy as a Modal scheduled function: `@app.function(schedule=modal.Cron(...))`, once daily.
- Secrets (Apify key, OpenRouter key, Google credentials, Telegram bot token) via Modal secrets —
  never committed.
- Wrap the scheduled run in try/except; on any failure send a Telegram alert named
  `JOB-APPLY-AGENT — WHAT BROKE`, then re-raise. No silent failures.

## 4. Out of Scope

- Auto-submitting applications. The agent prepares; a human still clicks apply.
- Multiple niches — Full-Stack Java/Spring Boot/Angular only, for now.
- Resume visual design/formatting polish beyond the text content.

## 5. Folder Structure (as built)

  .env                        # gitignored — Apify key, OpenRouter key, Google creds, Telegram bot token
```

## 6. Verification Per Step (for plan-mode / done-contract prompting on camera)

- Scrape: returns N jobs with title, company, link, description.
- Score: every job has a numeric score; jobs below 8 are excluded from all downstream steps.
- Tailor: output resume has no placeholder text and passes the validation hook.
- Sheet: row count matches qualifying-job count; every row has a working job link and resume
  reference.
- Desktop: folder count matches qualifying-job count; each folder has exactly one resume file.
- Headless run: `claude -p` completes with the same output as the interactive run, restricted to
  the allowed tools.
- Modal: scheduled function deploys, manual trigger runs end to end, forced failure produces the
  named Telegram alert.
